                <p>Shipping Options</p>
                <span>We offer a variety of shipping options to ensure that you receive your custom
                    funny t-shirts in a timely and convenient manner. During the checkout process,
                    you'll have the opportunity to choose from standard or expedited shipping. Our standard
                    shipping option delivers your t-shirts within 5-7 business days after production. This
                    is a cost-effective choice for those who don't need their items urgently. Need your
                    t-shirts sooner? Opt for expedited shipping, which typically delivers your order within
                    2-3 business days after production. Please note that expedited shipping may incur an
                    additional fee.</span>

                <p>Order Processing Time</p>
                <span>Once you place your order and your design is finalized, our team gets to work creating
                    your custom funny t-shirts. The order processing time includes design preparation,
                    printing, quality control, and packaging. This process usually takes 1-3 business days.</span>

                <p>Tracking Your Order</p>
                <span>As soon as your order is shipped, you'll receive an email notification with a tracking
                    number. You can use this tracking number to monitor the progress of your package and
                    get real-time updates on its location and estimated delivery date.</span>

                <p>Shipping Rates</p>
                <span>Shipping rates vary depending on your chosen shipping method, delivery location, and the number
                    of items in your order. Shipping costs will be calculated and displayed during the checkout process,
                    allowing you to make an informed choice.</span>

                <p>International Shipping</p>
                <span>We're thrilled to offer international shipping to our customers around the world. Please note
                    that international orders may be subject to customs and import duties, taxes, and fees. These
                    charges are the responsibility of the recipient and will vary depending on the destination
                    country's regulations.</span>

                    checkout. Double-check your shipping address, including any apartment or unit numbers, to prevent
                    any delays or misdeliveries.</span>
